# About Me
I am a PhD Candidate in [Decision, Risk, and Operations Division](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro) of the [Graduate Business School](https://business.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Assaf Zeevi](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/assaf-zeevi). Prior to my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research studies problems in revenue management and related operational settings where customer behavior is complex or where humanâ€“algorithm interaction shapes decisions. In addressing these challenges, I (i) develop optimal policies that provide managerial insights, (ii) design online learning algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, (iii) conduct empirical analysis of real-world data, and (iv) build decision-support systems that are both efficient and implementable in practice.

## Working Papers

**Modeling and Empirical Considerations in B2B Pricing**<br>
*with Assaf Zeevi, Gal Lex*<br>
A pricing decision-support system featuring a near-optimal suggestion structure that accounts for partial compliance in human-in-the-loop settings, and an empirical analysis based on real transaction data.

**Recommendation Policies in the Presence of Social Learning**<br>
*with Assaf Zeevi*<br>
A product recommendation framework under review-driven customer behavior, featuring an asymptotically optimal policy and showing that different customer types are best targeted at different stages of the selling horizon.

**Dynamic Pricing with Unknown Extent of Social Learning**<br>
*with Assaf Zeevi*<br>
A dynamic pricing framework with history-dependent demand influenced by prices and prior reviews, addressing the challenge of unknown demand through minimax-optimal online algorithms that significantly outperform predict-then-optimize methods.

## Work in Progress

**Learning under Indirect Price Control and Unobserved Confounding**<br>
