# About Me
I am a PhD Candidate in [Decision, Risk, and Operations Division](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/divisions/dro) of the [Graduate Business School](https://business.columbia.edu) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Assaf Zeevi](https://business.columbia.edu/faculty/people/assaf-zeevi). Prior to my PhD, I completed my undergraduate degree in Economics at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

My research studies problems in revenue management and related operational settings where customer behavior is complex or where humanâ€“algorithm interaction shapes decisions. In addressing these challenges, I (i) develop optimal policies that provide managerial insights, (ii) design online learning algorithms for decision making under uncertainty, (iii) conduct empirical analysis of real-world data, and (iv) build decision-support systems that are both efficient and implementable in practice.

*Modeling and Empirical Considerations in B2B Pricing*

with Assaf Zeevi, Gal Lex

A pricing decision-support system featuring a near-optimal suggestion structure that accounts for partial compliance in human-in-the-loop settings, and an empirical analysis based on real transaction data.
